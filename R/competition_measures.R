#' @title Worker level competition in QP
#'
#' @description
#' This function produces measures of competition using worker level information.
#' The first measure is "Out of Sample Hires", from Manchin "Monopsony", 1st chapter.
#' This measures the proportion of workers hired from outside of the sample.
#' A low proportion of poaches is an indicator of low competition.
#' The second measure is the Herfindahl Hirschman index (HHI) of employment.
#' Here, the market share is relative to share of employment,
#' instead of the typical sales variable.
#'
#' @param data A tibble
#' @param hiring_var Name of the variable indicating if the worker was hired. Not a string.
#' @param poach_var Name of the variable indicating id the worker was poached. Not a string.
#' @param firm_var The name of the firm identifier, used for HHI. Not a string.
#'
#' @param ... The grouping to compute competitiveness for. Should contain "year".
